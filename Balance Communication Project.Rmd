title: "Balance Communication Project"

Goals: Create a code using python that will communicate with a balance, take readings at certain time intervals, and also put those readings into a .csv file.

Part 1: Levi - Establish communication with balance. 

#!/usr/bin/env python3
import time
import serial
import csv

def conscale():
	ser=serial.Serial(
		port='/dev/ttyUSB0',
		baudrate=9600,
		parity='N',
		stopbits=serial.STOPBITS_ONE,
		bytesize=serial.SEVENBITS,
		timeout=None);
	x=ser.readline()
	return x

The code above was designed to communicate and take readings from the balance. During the development and trouble shooting of the code we decided that it would be much easier to interface through a raspberry pi and so that is what we used to design the code. The first part of this project was determining the port that the raspberry pi was using to communicate through the balance. It was determined that the port was '/dev/ttyUSB0',. After determining port I was able to call the port and look at all of communication pieces that the balance was sending to the raspberry pi. These pieces include baudrate, parity, stopbits, bytesize, timeout, and .......... After determining the communication pieces I had to mirror those pieces with my code to get proper communication with the balance. After the communication pieces had been added to the code I used print x to determine that i had established a way to get the data from the balance. This code printed every single mass reading into the python block.

Part 2: Gus - Design code to take readings at certain time intervals
#For the function i am contributing to, i am looking into possible software that will allow the scale to take readings at certain time intervals. I have been specifically looking into RsWeight programs to help with the issue. In the program, one can set many perameters and take readings at specific intervals. There is options in this program to export to an Excell file and have the data arranged respectively. Need to see what components are required for the specific program and if its a possibility.
I believe the code below will take readings every 10 seconds by continuously exucuting Levis code.
I need to figure out a stop code so it will not take measurments continuously


import time

def readmass():
    LEVIS CODE IS INSERTED HERE I BELIEVE
    time.sleep(10)

while True:
    readmass()
    
Some redactions... this is edited code that has a "stop time" 
Emily needs to add csv file code

def readmass():
	t_end = time.time() + 15;
	emily needs to make csv file to report to
		while time.time() < t_end:
			'python writes to csv'
			time.sleep(3)

Part 3: Emily - Design code to insert readings into certain parts of a .csv file.
After the readings are collected at specific time intervals and recorded, they will need to be placed in an orderly fasion in a program. 
Excel will not be used, but rather a csv file. A csv file is is a delimited text file that uses a comma to separate values. 
A CSV file is different than a XLS file because a CSV format is a plain text format in which values are seperated by commas. An XLS file format is an Excel sheets binary file format that hold information about all the worksheets in a file, both content and formatting. 
Code will be created in order to place the recordings in certain cells in the .csv file. The recordings will be labeled accordingly using a code. 
This is the last step in the project, so research is continuing on the best way to format the data in the .csv file, while we establish communication with the scale. 
This is just a start there may need to be more added.

Import CSV
Result = ()
with open('output.csv', 'w') as csvfile:
    csvwriter = csv.writer(csvfile)
    for row in result.items():
        csvwriter.writerow(row)
